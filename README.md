# PrivacyApp
[My-privacy.online](https://www.my-privacy.online/) is a website that allows users to select the services they use and returns info about the state of their online privacy.

We will be monetizing this site by requesting to become a publisher of [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/).

UX flow: 
1. The user checks the boxes corresponding to the services he uses and clicks the submit button

2. Using the TOSDR API we return a result screen with an easily understandable representation of the user's results with graphs.
